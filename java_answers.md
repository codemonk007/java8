java is a object oriented compilable language .
write code-> byte code-> runanywhere
JVM is muchine specific

Eeverything revolves around state and behavior 
class concept and we have to instantiate from a class to execute anything .

static blocks 
main method.

Constructor-> using new keyword-> using reflection classes
Static classes

OOPS 
Abstarction :- showing nessessary portion and hiding the remaining .
else we can have default methods.

child class nessasarily should implement / override all the methgods.

Encapsulation :
wrapping the state and behavior in to single unit 
    getter and setter . private members.

inherritance:
    more general methods defination in parent classes.
    child class can implemet it .
    multi level inherritance 
    code re usability 
    composition over is -a relationship.
polymorphism
    compile time  -> constructor overloading , method overloading 
    run time -> method overriding 
    upcasting 
    downcastig 
Collection :
group of hetrogenious objects into a single enity.
List -> interface
Collections -> interface
    Implemeted classes-
        Arraylist
        linkedlist
        Vecto -> thread safe.

set ->
    insertion order is not guaranteed
    unique items.
    linkedhasset -> insertion order is gaurabteed
    treeset -> insertion order is not gaurantted but goes with oven

Map:
    Insertion order is based on k-v pair.
    hashmap;
    linked hashmap
    tree map;
--------------
multi threading :
    extending thread class and ovverriding run methgod
    implemnting an interface called runnable
        ovverride th emethod run;
    Transient variables.
    syncronuos
    thredpull fool.
    sleep
    prioritize
------------
functional interface 
only one abstract method and many default methods.
predicate test .
function apply 
consumer apply 
supplier 

stream.filter.sort.distinct.limit.reduce
